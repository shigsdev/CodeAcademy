This article will help you review Python functions by providing some code challenges involving functions.

Some of these challenges are difficult! Take some time to think about them before starting to code.

You might not get the solution correct on your first try — look at your output, try to find where you’re going wrong, and iterate on your solution.

Finally, if you get stuck, use our solution code! If you “Check Answer” twice with an incorrect solution, you should see an option to get our solution code. However, truly investigate that solution — experiment and play with the solution code until you have a good grasp of how it is working. Good luck!

Function Syntax
As a refresher, function syntax looks like this:

def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):
  # … do something with the inputs …
  return output
For example, a function that returns the sum of the first and last elements of a given list might look like this:

def first_plus_last(lst):
  return lst[0] + lst[-1]
And this would produce output like:

>>> first_plus_last([1, 2, 3, 4])
5
>>> first_plus_last([8, 2, 5, -8])
0
>>> first_plus_last([-10, 2, 3, -4])
-14
Challenges
We’ve included 5 challenges below. Try to answer all of them and polish up your problem-solving skills!

1. First Three Multiples

Write a function named first_three_multiples() that has one parameter named num.

This function should print the first three multiples of num. Then, it should return the third multiple.

For example, first_three_multiples(7) should print 7, 14, and 21 on three different lines, and return 21.

'''

def first_three_multiples(num):
    print(num,num*2,num*3)
    return(num*3)

print(first_three_multiples(10))
print(first_three_multiples(0))
