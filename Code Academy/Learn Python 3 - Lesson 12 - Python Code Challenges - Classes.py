Python Code Challenges: Classes
Python Code Challenges Involving Classes

This article will help you review Python classes by providing some interesting code challenges.

Some of these challenges are difficult! Take some time to think about them before starting to code.

You might not get the solution correct on your first try — look at your output, try to find where you’re going wrong,
and iterate on your solution.

Finally, if you get stuck, use our solution code! If you “Check Answer” twice with an incorrect solution, you should
see an option to get our solution code. However, truly investigate that solution — experiment and play with the
solution code until you have a good grasp of how it is working. Good luck!

Class Syntax
As a refresher, class syntax looks like this:

class MyClass:
    # ... class variables ...

    def __init__(self):
        # ... instance variables ...
For example, a class which defines a rectangle using a class variable, instance variables, and a method looks like this:

class Rectangle:
    sides = 4

    def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height


rectangle_1 = Rectangle(5, 10)
rect_area = rectangle_1.calculate_area()

The last two lines in the above example show how to initialize an object of the class as well as calling one of the
methods.

# Challenges You have decided to use your programming knowledge to create a new robotics company. Your idea for micro
# driving robots which are able to pick up and deliver objects was promising and now you want to start programming
# the logic. These code challenges will use your knowledge of Classes to solve some example scenarios. Try solving
# the five challenge problems below!

'''1. Setting Up Our Robot Let’s begin by creating the class for our robot. We will begin by setting up the instance 
variables to keep track of important data related to the robot. Here are the steps we need to do: 

Create a new class called DriveBot Set up a basic constructor (no parameters needed) Initialize three instance 
variables within our constructor which all default to 0: motor_speed, direction, and sensor_range 

'''


# Create a python class called DriveBot. Within this class, create instance variables for motor_speed, sensor_range,
# and direction. All of these should be initialized to 0 by default. After setting up the class, create an object
# from the class called robot_1. Set the motor_speed to 5, the direction to 90, and the sensor_range to 10. Use the
# provided print statements to check your work!

# Define the DriveBot class here!
class DriveBot:
    all_disabled = False
    latitute = -99999
    longitude = -99999
    robot_count = 0

    def __init__(self, motor_speed=0, direction=180, sensor_range=10):
        self.motor_speed = motor_speed
        self.direction = direction
        self.sensor_range = sensor_range
        DriveBot.robot_count += 1
        self.id = DriveBot.robot_count

    # Add the methods here!
    def control_bot(self, new_speed, new_direction):
        self.motor_speed = new_speed
        self.direction = new_direction

    def adjust_sensor(self, new_sensor_range):
        self.sensor_range = new_sensor_range


robot_1 = DriveBot()
robot_1 = DriveBot()
robot_1.motor_speed = 5
robot_1.direction = 90
robot_1.sensor_range = 10
print(robot_1.motor_speed)
print(robot_1.direction)
print(robot_1.sensor_range)

# This shows the structure of a simple class which only contains instance variables. The three instance variables are
# set to 0 for now, which means that they can only be changed by manually by accessing them from an object of the
# DriveBot class.

# 2. Adding Robot Logic Now we want to add some logic to our robot. It would be very useful to be able to control our
# robot, se we are going to create a control_bot method which changes the speed and direction. We are also going to
# create a method called adjust_sensor. This method is used to change the range of our robot’s sensors which are used
# to detect obstacles. Here are the steps:
#
# Define a function within the DriveBot class which accepts two additional parameters: one for a new speed and one
# for a new direction Replace the instance variables for speed and direction with the input parameters Define another
# function called adjust_sensor which accepts one additional parameter Replace the instance variable sensor_range
# with the input parameter

# Use the methods here!
robot_1.control_bot(10, 180)
robot_1.adjust_sensor(20)
print(robot_1.motor_speed)
print(robot_1.direction)
print(robot_1.sensor_range)

'''3. Enhanced Constructor It can be tedious manually setting the values for each instance variable after we have 
created an object from the DriveBot class. We can enhance our constructor to automatically assign the values we 
provide to the instance variables. Instead of taking zero parameters, we are going to make the constructor take three 
parameters. Here is what we need to do: 

Modify the constructor to take three parameters (in addition to self): one for motor_speed, one for direction, 
and one for sensor_range 
For the first parameter, make the default value 0 For the second parameter, make the default 
value 180 
For the third parameter, make the default value 10 
Within the constructor, replace the instance variables 
with the variables from the input parameters 

'''

# Upgrade the constructor in the DriveBot class in order to accept three optional parameters. The constructor can
# accept motor_speed (which defaults to 0 if not provided), direction (which defaults to 180 if not provided,
# and sensor_range (which defaults to 10 if not provided). These parameters should replace the associated instance
# variables. Test out the upgraded constructor by initializing a new robot called robot_2 with a speed of 35,
# a direction of 75, and a sensor range of 25.


# Create robot_2 here!
robot_2 = DriveBot(35, 75, 25)

print(robot_2.motor_speed)
print(robot_2.direction)
print(robot_2.sensor_range)

# This upgraded constructor includes input parameters as well as default values for those parameters. This means that
# if no value is provided for those parameters, then the value they are set equal to will be used. Here are some
# examples of different ways to use the constructor:

# sensor_range defaults to 10
test_bot_1 = DriveBot(10, 270)

# direction defaults to 180
test_bot_2 = DriveBot(sensor_range=20, motor_speed=45)

# direction defaults to 180 and sensor_range defaults to 10
test_bot_3 = DriveBot(50)

# all default values are used
test_bot_4 = DriveBot()

# no default values are used
test_bot_5 = DriveBot(18, 95, 30)
'''# 4. Controlling Them All # We want to add a new feature which allows the use to control multiple robots at once. 
The robots should be able to all have the same latitude and longitude GPS destination coordinates as well as a 
setting for disabling them all called all_disabled. We can accomplish this using class variables. Here is how we can 
do it: # # Create a new class variable within the DriveBot class called all_disabled and set it equal to False # 
Create a new class variable within the DriveBot class called latitude and set it equal to -999999 # Create a new 
class variable within the DriveBot class called longitude and set it equal to -999999 # Outside of the class, 
test the class variables by setting the longitude of all robots to 50.0, the latitude to -50.0 and all_disabled to True 

'''
robot_3 = DriveBot(20, 60, 10)
# Change the latitude, longitude, and all_disabled values for all three robots using only three lines of code!
DriveBot.longitude = 50.0
DriveBot.latitude = -50.0
DriveBot.all_disabled = True
print(robot_1.latitude)
print(robot_2.longitude)
print(robot_3.all_disabled)

# Here are the changes we made in the class:
#
# class DriveBot: all_disabled = False latitude = -999999 longitude = -999999 We placed the class variables at the
# top of the class outside of the constructor. These variables can be accessed within the scope of the entire class.
# This means that the class variables contained within every object from the DriveBot class will change if we modify
# the class variable directly. Here is an example of how to change each of these class variables:
#
# DriveBot.longitude = -79.98553
# DriveBot.latitude = 40.60793
# DriveBot.all_disabled = False

'''5. Identifying Robots In order to keep track of the robots we are creating, we want to be able to assign an ID 
value to each robot when it is created. If we create five robots in a row, we want the IDs of each robot to be 1, 2, 
3, 4, and 5 respectively. This can be accomplished by using a class variable counter which increments and is assigned 
to an instance variable for the ID whenever the constructor is called. Here are the steps: 

Create a new class variable in the DriveBot class called robot_count
In the constructor, increment the robot_count by 1
After incrementing the value, assign the value of robot_count to a new instance variable called id.
'''

# Within the DriveBot class, create an instance variable called id which will be assigned to the robot when the
# object is created. Every time a robot is created, increment a counter (stored as a class variable) so that the next
# robot will have a different id. For example, if three robots were created: first_robot, next_robot, and last_robot;
# first_robot will have an id of 1 next_robot will have an id of 2 and last_robot will have an id of 3.

robot_3 = DriveBot(20, 60, 10)

print(robot_1.id)
print(robot_2.id)
print(robot_3.id)

# The final modifications to this class can be seen at the top of the class and in the constructor. We use a class
# variable to keep track of the total number of robots. This information is shared across all robot objects we create
# from the class. Every time a robot object is created, the constructor is called and the count is incremented. Each
# robot has an instance variable for id which is local to that robot object. This is assigned at the time of
# construction and stores what the count was at that time.
